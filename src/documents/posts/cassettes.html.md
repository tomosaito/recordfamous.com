### It’s never been easier to find and miss good music

As an immigrant, my musical background was equally Indian Raga, Billboard 40 and Gospel, so I make no definitive claims to western music expertise. As a teen, I was pretty resourceful at getting new music, from radio mixtape recordings to a CD exchange loophole I exploited. Still, my teen musical collection was categorically bland and over played.

Something changed when torrent trackers for independent music emerged. I didn’t have much interest in Napster but the hip factor of non RIAA music was undeniable. I lavished in independent music and film, obscure art previously unavailable to the senses of the masses, the accessible sounds of diversity, Ethiopiques, Anatolian Rock, Pyschedelic and Bollywood Funk.

> It was against the mono crop of commercial music, that independent music stole my 20’s heart.

But past the early days of music piracy and into the streaming era, the egalitarian and democratic promises of digital music still hasn’t quite materialized.

The 200Gb hard drive, the pride of my music collection has long since expired. In it’s place are towers of tapes, a few crates of vinyl and a shoebox of letters, pins and stickers from artists.

In a noisy digital world where we define success quantitively rather than qualitatively, by SEO rather than sound, it seemed intuitive to limit my music discovery to cassette audio from labels far outside music monetization. You may be surprised to learn that tape production is at a high. In the vestiges of artistic music, you find sprouted communities curating their favorite bands and releasing them in analog and digital on Bandcamp. I have yet to hear any complaints, from listeners, labels or artists. I’m amazed at how many labels sprout every week. As it turns out, tapes and digital are both democratic mediums, does the slogan, *Home Taping Is Killing Music* sound familiar?

> I’m an album listener, I prefer the focus and attentiveness it demands.

Actively writing about music, the textures, connotations and stories drives that heart feel even deeper for me. Finding the time for it between freelancing, a startup and social life can be a sacrifice, but it holds importance is derived from the things that we give our attention to. By which I mean, if you have trouble finding good music, you aren’t looking hard enough, you want it free or you’re friends are no good.

> There is music of just about every flavor, for just about every feeling, if you put some effort into it. Just don’t go to Dairy Queen expecting Gelato.

My current cassette flavors include lost 90’s California New Age, Psychedelic Garage Rock and Instrumental Hip Hop. With the winter approaching, I’m getting in the mood for the softer warmth of Cascadia Folk and Ambient. My tastes say as much about me and my moods as anything else, it’s a focus of mine as much as food, fashion and coffee. I also took a hipstocratic oath a decade ago, to seek out and support the small arts.

> Cultural appreciation will always be an active practice and music streaming still seems far too passive for this listener.

Sure there are times for easy listening, my bedtime selection tonight is a cassette from 1993, Spin the Cat. A thrift store find with no available information except for a defunct 415 phone number. It’s a simple but effective composition of marimba, violin, cello, and freak folk percussion with world leanings that will put me right to dreamland.
